# Early-diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-through-Deep-Learning

This repository currently consists only the pre-processed ADNI data along with the Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity (AD) results generated using our proposed model that leverages the attention mechanism


## The main contributions of this article are:
• The proposed model efficiently learns spatial correlation in neighboring voxels, thereby improving the robustness of diffusion tensor imaging parameters.

• The proposed method speeds up the estimation of DTI parameters using sparse measurements.

• The proposed model exhibits the capability to quantitative diffusion parameters and identify early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
